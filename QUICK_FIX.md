## Your Issue: Cannot add results / No results showing

## 🔧 SOLUTION (Follow in order):

### Step 1: Compile C++ Program

## 📝 Quick Checklist:

- [ ] Ran: `g++ backend_server.cpp -o Student_Result_Management_Enhanced.exe`
- [ ] File `Student_Result_Management_Enhanced.exe` exists in folder
- [ ] Ran: `npm install` (one time only)
- [ ] Ran: `npm start`

## 🎯 MOST LIKELY FIX:

The problem is probably that the .exe file is old or doesn't exist.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Stop server if running (Ctrl+C)
g++ backend_server.cpp -o Student_Result_Management_Enhanced.exe
npm start
# Then open http://localhost:3000
```
